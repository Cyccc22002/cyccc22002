# REFRAD or Transition?: the TSR program

With life changing you maybe looking to leave Active Duty (REFRAD). If you are dead set on separating from the military, there is not much one can say to change that (not that they should). Having the strength to know that your personal needs, family or otherwise, are more important and should be prioritized as such. There are many resources that are available to help with that transition. <br/>  I will offer an alternative if you happen to be on the fence about leaving the military, or have time left on your contract and looking for options. Transitioning to the Reserves, may it be the National Guard or Army Reserves, may be the stability and work/life balance you are looking for. <br/> You are probably reading this as an Cyber person, seeing that this is a Cyber Captains Career Course blog site. With that, there is a pilot program (by the time you are reading this, most likely complete) called the Tailored Strategic Retention Program (TSRP). <br/><br/>
**Vision:**  Build a multi-pathway reserve component retention program for **transitioning AC Cyber Mission Force (OFF/WO/NCO) in specific work roles with intent of retaining 25-50% trained/ready CMF Soldiers** in specific RC formations and programs if Soldiers are wanting to transition from AD. <br/><br/>
**Background:** Tailored Strategic Retention (TSR) is a USCYBERCOM Academic Engagement initiative designed to retain Soldiers trained and certified in USCYBERCOM work roles in the Reserves. The program, funded by the National Security Agency, received $500K in FY21-22 through the Senior Military Colleges DOD Cyber Institutes grant. USCYBERCOM selected the Army to pilot the program, with an Initial Operational Capability (IOC) declared on 5 JAN 2022. **TSR’s primary focus is to incentivize active-duty Soldiers trained and certified in cyber work roles to transition into Reserve Component units.** The program is capable of supporting 50 transitioning Service members to March FY23.

### ARCYBER TSR TEAM WILL ONLY ENGAGE TRANSITIONING AC MEMBERS WITHIN LAST 9 MONTHS OF THEIR ETS DATE.<br/><br/>

|The ARCYBER Reserve Affairs Division (RAD) has been directed by the CG, ARCYBER to run the ARCYBER Tailored Strategic Retention Program (TSRP) which is part of the U.S Cyber Command’s TSRP. The following Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures will be validated and utilized as the process to execute the TSRP for active component cyber soldiers to achieve successful transition into a reserve component unit (ARNG or USAR) to continue to work in their cyber role or job and contribute to the Army as a member of the RC cyber community.<br/>The goal of the ARCYBER TSRP is to help Reserve Component agencies transition talented, highly trained Soldiers, Officers and Warrant Officers a.k.a. Active Component Transition Members (ACTM) transitioning from the Active Component. **The TSRP offers incentives for cyber ACTM, transitioning from active duty having the CMF work rolls**, to continue supporting as cyber-warriors in RC units (ARNG/USAR). TSRP is designed specifically for the cyber workforce, fostering career skills, continued education, and direct links with private industry. The program’s goal is to increase Reserve Component forces augmenting the Cyber Mission Force (CMF) and enhance total force readiness. TSRP is an ARCYBER pilot program with funding through March FY23.|To achieve success the ARCYBER TSR team will coordinate and collaborate with the following members external to ARCYBER:<br/> **1. ARCYBER ACTM cyber soldier approved to participate in the TSRP**<br/>**2. The POC at CYBER Command that runs and manages the TSRP**<br/>**The Reserve Component Career Counselor at the Installation where AC soldier works**<br/>**3. The ARNG and USAR Cyber Branch Career Counselors (one each)**<br/>**4. The ARNG and USAR Cyber Division representatives (one each)**<br/>**5. The full-time S1 and OIC of 91st Cyber Brigade**<br/>**6. The full-time S1 and OIC of the AR Cyber Protection Brigade**|

MIB-E/MIRC<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f. RC Joint Cyber billets| 1.Initial tracking of ACTM ETS 9 months thru AC BDE SGMs and unit Counselors<br/>2. Identify/track ACTM approved for TSR 6 months from transition date.<br/>3. Link vacancies to ACTM based on Tier and Location<br/>4. Provide two matches based on state location, MOS, Job Role<br/>5. Setup interview with unit leadership and ACTM within 7-10 days of TSR decision<br/> 6. ACTM does Virtual or In person interview with unit<br/> 7. If unit is a fit on both sides, ACTM and interviewer sign interview document and letter of acceptance and send to the RC Career Counselor and the ARCYBER TSR Coordinator.<br/> 8. RC Career Counselor contract ACTM in the ARNG or USAR and work with unit, agency, and state if ARNG placing the ACTM in the State ARNG. <br/>9. ACTM placed into the TSRP by USCC TSR Rep for education and employment opportunities<br/> 10. ACTM receives orders and corresponds with new unit on start date.<br/> 11. Three months after ACTM starts with unit ARCYBER TSRP conducts survey with ACTM and closes out tracking.|
