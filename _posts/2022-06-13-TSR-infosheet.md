With life changing you maybe looking to leave Active Duty (REFRAD). If you are dead set on separating from the military, there is not much one can say to change that (not that they should). Having the strength to know that your personal needs, family or otherwise, are more important and should be prioritized as such. There are many resources that are available to help with that transition. <br/>  I will offer an alternative if you happen to be on the fence about leaving the military, or have time left on your contract and looking for options. Transitioning to the Reserves, may it be the National Guard or Army Reserves, may be the stability and work/life balance you are looking for. <br/> You are probably reading this as an Cyber person, seeing that this is a Cyber Captains Career Course blog site. With that, there is a pilot program (by the time you are reading this, most likely complete) called the Tailored Strategic Retention Program (TSRP). <br/><br/>
**Vision:**  Build a multi-pathway reserve component retention program for **transitioning AC Cyber Mission Force (OFF/WO/NCO) in specific work roles with intent of retaining 25-50% trained/ready CMF Soldiers** in specific RC formations and programs if Soldiers are wanting to transition from AD. <br/><br/>
**Background:** Tailored Strategic Retention (TSR) is a USCYBERCOM Academic Engagement initiative designed to retain Soldiers trained and certified in USCYBERCOM work roles in the Reserves. The program, funded by the National Security Agency, received $500K in FY21-22 through the Senior Military Colleges DOD Cyber Institutes grant. USCYBERCOM selected the Army to pilot the program, with an Initial Operational Capability (IOC) declared on 5 JAN 2022. **TSRâ€™s primary focus is to incentivize active-duty Soldiers trained and certified in cyber work roles to transition into Reserve Component units.** The program is capable of supporting 50 transitioning Service members to March FY23.
