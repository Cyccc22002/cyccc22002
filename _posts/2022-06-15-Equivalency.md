## Background 
As a I VTIP from Signal and traverse the grey space that is Army transfers, I want to help the next person know where to look and who to talk to IOT alleviate some of the pain. *Although being in the Guard might be making the transfer a bit harder.* Regardless the information herein should help you on your efforts to, lets say, bypass some Army requirements for 17A (17B being developed). As a disclaimer, I am not a VTIP expert but sharing my experience and how I am working through it.

***This is assuming you have completed the initial VTIP process to get  acceptance into the 17X branch.***<br/>
If there is interest I can build a post that can explain the VTIP process.  

## Course Credit SOP
This is the "most" current SOP that I can find. 22 January 2021<br/>

## Packet template
When requesting credit, you are required to build the request through a template that is then reviewed at a board to decide what gets accepted and what remains to gain full equivalency. Below is the newest packet template that you will need to build out. If you do not have the certification or the class specified, more information is the best way to campion your case for credit.

Here is the example that is used.<br/>

***the example is older than the newest worksheet above. Although all that changed is the worksheet portion***

## Sources of equivalency information
MilSuite is a CAC enabled site that allows for a forum based communication. The information gathered above comes from one o the updated posts regarding the PME courses and equivalency standards. I would advise checking the post [here](https://www.milsuite.mil/book/docs/DOC-748306) if there are any updates to the SOP. At the time of writing this post it had a relatively new change posted updating the revamped CyCCC course and annotating the recall of using PWK as a CsRA replacement. 

Within the post linked above there are contact information directing who would receive your completed credit packet. It should not be a surprise that the Guard has a different POC than Compo 1 and 3. Please tak note of that.

## Timeline
This is a tricky subject, with the go to cyber answer of *"it depends"*.  Although I will do my best describing the lowest amount of time to the "most" amount of time.<br/>
As it stands now, if you are coming to Cyber without equivalency in any subject, you can expect to be mandated to attend:<br/>
![Cyber-Courses](/assets/images/Cyber-class-length.png)<br/>
That is not including gaining your 8140 requirements.<br/>
For the lowest amount of time, there is a chance of earning full qualification out the gate with your VTIP request. Although with the branch growing and requirements changing I can say that is becoming less of an option.
