## Background 
As a I VTIP from Signal and traverse the grey space that is Army transfers, I want to help the next person know where to look and who to talk to IOT alleviate some of the pain. *Although being in the Guard might be making the transfer a bit harder.* Regardless the information herein should help you on your efforts to, lets say, bypass some Army requirements for 17A (17B being developed). As a disclaimer, I am not a VTIP expert but sharing my experience and how I am working through it.

***This is assuming you have completed the initial VTIP process to get  acceptance into the 17X branch.***<br/>
If there is interest I can build a post that can explain the VTIP process.

## Packet template
When requesting credit, you are required to build the request through a template that is then reviewed at a board to decide what gets accepted and what remains to gain full equivalency. Below is the newest packet template that you will need to build out. If you do not have the certification or the class specified, more information is the best way to campion your case for credit.
