## Background 
As a I VTIP from Signal and traverse the grey space that is Army transfers, I want to help the next person know where to look and who to talk to IOT alleviate some of the pain. *Although being in the Guard might be making the transfer a bit harder.* Regardless the information herein should help you on your efforts to, lets say, bypass some Army requirements for 17A (17B being developed). As a disclaimer, I am not a VTIP expert but sharing my experience and how I am working through it.
