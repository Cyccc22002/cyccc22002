# What I wish I knew, Growing as a leader
As I look back on my career in the Army, may it be the Guard or otherwise, I find myself thinking about the information and procedures that I know now that would've changed how I handled situations. Although I am not "Pure Cyber" many things can blanket across all MOSs and just be general knowledge assisting in being an Army Officer.<br/>

I was having dinner with a few of my LT's as an impromptu OPD while we are all out at Gordon doing out respective PME schooling, as a few of them I donâ€™t get to see often through a byproduct of the Guard splitting a CPT across states. Knowledge gaps were being identified, what some would find trivial, though only if you know you should be thinking about it. Some of the topics in this post may be a direct correlation to the Guard just as a TLDR is any of my COMPO 1 or 3 happen to read this. But regardless take what you will from it.
