## ArmyIgnitED/ArmyCool (Credentiling Opportunities On-line)
### Overview
The ArmyIgnited Credentialing Assistance program has been around for a while, supporting Soldiers in progressing their proffesional education. If you are unfamilliar with the assistance programs there are two types; Credential Assistance and Tuition Assistance. Of which they each have their strengths and weaknesses. Now I will be focusing on the CA portion of ArmyIgnited, having a overview of providing **$4k** each **fiscal year**.  

### Elegibility
One big point is you must be serving in the Army currently, may it be in any Component (Regular Army, the Army National Guard/Army National Guard of the United States, and the U.S. Army Reserve). The CA program is available to enlisted, warrant officers, and officers. According their site, Officers must have completed BOLC prior to getting claims accepted, although there are cases of using your MOS as a case to get it prior for those long running BOLCs (Aviation and Cyber for example).
